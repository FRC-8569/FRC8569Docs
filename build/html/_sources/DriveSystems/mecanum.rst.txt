Mecanum Chassis tutorial
========================

A mecanum chassis must be built with at least four wheels—one motor for each wheel—in order to drive the robot properly.

You can also use the motors from the `KOP <KOP.html>`_ here — now let's check out the driving kinematics.

Because of the characteristics of the mecanum wheel, the robot can perform more complex movements, such as x-y panning and driving while rotating like the image below.

This image demonstrates how the chassis responds to various wheel spin patterns. Each wheel's motion can be described as follows:

In this image, each side has three wheels powered by two motors. The motors allow the robot to move forward and backward, and by varying the speed between the two sides, you can make it turn.

You can program your KOP chassis in this method:

Software Installation:
    SparkMax + NEO v1.1:
        Software VendorDeps: REVLib

    TalonSRX + CIM:
        Software VendorDeps: Phoneix 5

    TalonFX (kraken):
